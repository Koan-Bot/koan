# Skill Spec — `review`

## Command(s)

- **Primary:** `/review [--now] <pr-or-issue-url> [more urls] [context] [flags]`
  or `/review <repo-url> [--limit=N]`
- **Aliases:** `rv`, `rereview`, `re_review`
- **Group:** `code`

## Purpose

Queue a code-review mission for one or more GitHub PRs/issues. The agent reviews the
diff and posts findings as a review comment. The default review can be sharpened with
focus passes (architecture, silent-failure hunting, comment quality, plan alignment).

See `docs/users/skills.md` for the end-user `/review` reference and
`docs/users/user-manual.md` for the fuller walkthrough.

## Inputs

| Input | Source | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PR/issue URL(s) | command arg | yes (or repo URL) | multiple allowed; parsed by `github_url_parser` |
| repo URL + `--limit=N` | command arg | alt form | batch-review N open PRs |
| `--now` | flag | no | queue at top |
| `--architecture` | flag | no | SOLID/layering focus |
| `--errors` | flag | no | silent-failure-hunter pass |
| `--comments` | flag | no | comment-quality pass |
| `--plan-url <issue-url>` | flag | no | check PR against its plan |
| `--force` | flag | no | review even if closed/merged or pause-label is present |
| trailing context | command arg | no | extra reviewer guidance |
| `.koan/config.yaml` `review.always_check` | target repo file | no | file globs pinned into the reviewed diff (see Invariants) |

## Outputs / side effects

- Queues a review mission (one per URL); the agent loop runs it.
- Posts a review comment to the PR with a branded footer (`pr_footer.py`). The
  footer advertises the reviewed tip as `` `HEAD=<short-sha>` ``.
- If the PR branch's live HEAD moved between when the review captured its diff and
  when the comment is posted (a push or force-push mid-review), a
  `> [!IMPORTANT]` stale-HEAD alert is appended to the end of the comment.
- When the incremental-review check finds no new commits since the last review
  (all current SHAs already reviewed, no re-request), the run posts a short
  `> [!NOTE]` (blue) comment telling the requester the review was skipped because
  the code is unchanged — instead of skipping silently. The user asked (via
  `/review` or an @mention) and gets an answer rather than only the thumbs-up ack.
- Review prompt is enriched with `{ISSUE_CONTEXT}` from `issue_tracker/enrichment.py`.

## Error cases

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| invalid/missing URL | reply with usage |
| closed/merged target | skipped unless `--force` |
| pause-label present | success-with-skip unless `--force` (see invariant) |
| unresolved project | alias resolution then skip if unknown |

## Integration hooks

- **Handler:** `handler.py`. **GitHub:** `github_enabled` + `github_context_aware`.
- **Combo member:** part of `review_rebase` (`/rr`) and `ultrareview`.
- **Async:** runs as a queued agent-loop mission.

## Invariants

- Multi-URL queues preserve order via a single atomic locked insert.
- Findings are advisory comments — `/review` never merges or pushes code.
- **Read-only is enforced by a positive allowlist, not by omission.**
  `review_mode` is a member of `app.provider.READ_ONLY_ROLES`, so every review
  pass is restricted to `READ_ONLY_TOOLS` via `--tools` and *additionally* denies
  `SIDE_EFFECT_TOOLS`. Passing only
  `["Read","Glob","Grep"]` to `allowed_tools` does **not** withhold the rest:
  `--allowedTools` pre-approves invocations, it does not restrict which tools
  exist — the CLI's own reference says *"To restrict which tools are available,
  use `--tools` instead"*. Verified on Claude CLI 2.1.234: under
  `--allowedTools Read,Glob,Grep` a `Bash` call still succeeds, while under
  `--disallowedTools Bash` it is blocked. Enforcement strength is
  provider-dependent: Claude and ollama-launch deny by name; Codex ignores tool
  arguments entirely and is instead pinned to `--sandbox read-only`. Every other
  adapter declares neither and is refused — for reasons that differ per provider
  (`cline`/`haze` cannot express a restriction at all; `copilot`'s adapter does
  not wire up the CLI's `--deny-tool`; `grok` emits tool flags but Kōan has not
  measured that they withhold, and it auto-approves unconditionally). See
  `specs/components/providers.md` for the per-provider detail — the predicate is
  a claim about Kōan's adapter, not about the vendor CLI. A read-only role
  also refuses to honour `skip_permissions`, because
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` / `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`
  would bypass the very denial that makes the role read-only.
- **A review runs against a disposable checkout of the PR head, never the
  operator's working tree.** Missions are dispatched after
  `git_prep.prepare_project_branch`, which checks out the *base* branch and
  hard-resets it to `<remote>/<base>` — so the reviewed code was historically
  never on disk, while the prompts told the model to verify against "the
  checked-out code". `/review` therefore creates a detached worktree pinned to
  GitHub's live `headRefOid`, verifies the SHA twice (after fetch, and after
  checkout), asserts the tree is clean, and removes it afterwards.
- **A failed pin FAILS the review; it never falls back to `project_path`.**
  Reviewing the wrong tree and reporting the findings as fact is the defect this
  invariant exists to remove — a silent fallback reproduces it with a warning
  nobody reads. A failed review is visible and retriable; a wrong review is
  neither.
- **Prompts and skills come from the running Kōan, never from the reviewed
  tree.** `skill_dir` resolves from the installed module, so a pull request
  cannot rewrite the prompt that judges it.
- **The review shell is gated, and the gate fails to "no shell".** `Bash` is in
  `READ_ONLY_TOOLS` but is *never* placed in `--allowedTools`; each command is
  adjudicated by a `PreToolUse` hook supplied per-invocation via `--settings`.
  If that hook does not load for any reason, `Bash` is un-pre-approved and
  headless mode denies it. The failure mode is therefore losing the shell, not
  gaining an unguarded one — measured on Claude CLI 2.1.235, where a hook
  returning `allow` let a command run with no `Bash` entry in `--allowedTools`,
  and one returning `deny` blocked it with the reason surfaced and no side
  effect.
- **The shell is read-only by policy, one command per call.** Shell operators —
  redirection, chaining, command substitution — are rejected on the raw string
  before parsing, because `shlex` is a word splitter and not a shell parser: it
  happily returns `['git','log','>','x']`, which a token-level check would pass
  and Bash would then execute as a redirect. The pipe operator is *quote-aware*:
  an **unquoted** `|` is a genuine pipeline and is rejected (every stage would
  need validating, and a `tee`/`sh`/`dd` in stage two defeats stage one), while
  a `|` inside a quoted argument — a regex alternation such as
  `git grep -n 'a\|b' src` — is a literal character Bash passes to the program
  and can never start a second command, so it is allowed.
  **Stderr-only redirection is the one redirection allowed**, in exactly the
  spellings `2>/dev/null` and `2>&1` (optional single space after `2>`, and only
  when the whole form stands as its own word). Neither can create or truncate a
  file — `/dev/null` discards and `&1` merges into an existing stream — so
  neither turns a reader into a writer, which is the property the redirection
  ban exists to hold. They are recognised and elided from the raw string
  *before* the structural scan, so every other `>`/`<` (including
  `2>/tmp/anything`, `&>`, and a second `>` alongside an allowed form) is still
  rejected. This is a deliberate narrowing of the previous absolute ban:
  `2>/dev/null` is the idiom a reviewer reaches for constantly, denying it
  taught the model nothing it could act on, and the denials cost real turns and
  provider budget on every review.
  `koan/app/review_bash_guard.py` is the enumeration; this spec governs the
  policy.
- **Operands are confined to the pinned worktree by resolution, not by
  spelling.** Every file/dir operand is resolved (`realpath`, symlinks
  included) against the session's `cwd` — itself resolved — and must land on
  that directory or inside it. An **absolute path that resolves inside the
  worktree is allowed**, because it names a tree this shell may already read and
  because `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep` accept the same path: a `Bash` gate that
  disagrees with the file tools about one path emits a denial the model cannot
  believe (the review worktree is not "outside the review worktree") and it
  retries instead of rephrasing. A `~` operand stays rejected outright — Bash,
  not `shlex`, expands it, so the guard never sees the path it will become.
  Denials name the resolved path, so the reason is checkable rather than
  assertive.
- **No allowlisted program may execute another, or read the process
  environment.** The allowlist adjudicates the *invoked* program, so a flag that
  makes an allowed program run a second one launders any binary past the
  dangerous-command check — `git grep -O<prog>` / `--open-files-in-pager=<prog>`
  executes `<prog>` with the matched files (taken from the PR head under review)
  as its arguments, and is denied for that reason rather than as a write. Note
  `-o` (writes a file) and `-O` (executes) are different flags and the match is
  case-sensitive. Separately, operand containment keeps reads inside the review
  worktree, but the **process environment** is not a path: the review CLI
  inherits Kōan's own environ, so `jq`'s `env` builtin and `$ENV` variable are
  denied — otherwise a hostile PR's injected prompt could read the operator's API
  keys and tokens and post them in the review body. `$ENV` inside single quotes
  is inert to Bash, so the expansion check does not see it; jq's own accessors
  must be denied directly. A field merely *named* `env` (`jq .env config.json`)
  is an ordinary read and stays allowed.
- **An unenforceable review provider is REFUSED, not downgraded.** If the
  resolved `review_mode` provider (or the `cli.fallback` it swapped to) can
  enforce neither mechanism, `build_full_command` raises
  `ReadOnlyUnenforceable` and the review fails with an actionable configuration
  error naming the provider and `cli.review_mode`. `/review` never executes
  against an unenforceable provider — a review that could write to the live
  project clone is worse than no review, and the user-facing docs promise the
  boundary unconditionally. Operators on `cline`/`haze`/`copilot`/`grok`/`gemini` must pin
  `cli.review_mode` to `claude`, `codex`, or `ollama-launch`; the refused
  providers stay available for every other role. This covers the `/review` skill, which runs
  through `run_command_streaming`. It does **not** cover the separate
  `autonomous_mode == "review"` mission path in
  `mission_runner.build_mission_command` — see `specs/components/providers.md`.
- **Finding IDs span the complete review.** Displayed IDs start at 1 and
  increment through rendered severity order (Blocking, Important, Suggestions),
  then continue through Silent Failure Analysis findings. IDs never restart at
  a section boundary. Checklist references use these global IDs, letting a
  requester identify any specific finding without also naming its section.
- **Repo-level `always_check` pinning.** A target repo's optional
  `.koan/config.yaml` may set `review.always_check` to a list of file globs; any
  changed file whose path or basename matches is **pinned** so diff-size reduction
  includes it ahead of budgeted files and never silently drops it, and it does not
  appear in the `⚠️ Partial review` coverage note when included. Absent/empty/malformed
  config is a byte-identical no-op. Pinning reorders inclusion only (never raises the
  budget) and changes **neither the review schema nor the prompt templates**, so the
  eval golden dataset/baseline are unaffected. Contract:
  `specs/components/skills.md` → "`review` diff-size & partial-coverage contract" and
  "Repo config file (`.koan/config.yaml`)". User docs: `docs/users/koan-md.md`.
- **Pause label:** When `get_review_pause_label()` is non-empty and the PR
  carries that exact label, `run_review` returns success-with-skip **before**
  `fetch_pr_context`, prompt build, or any provider invocation. `force=True`
  / `--force` bypasses. Does not apply to `run_private_review`. Empty config
  (`review_pause_label: ""`) disables the check entirely. Default label name
  is `PauseReview`.
- **Verdict follows severity, not vibes.** `lgtm` (the merge verdict that drives
  the GitHub APPROVE / request-changes) is `true` whenever no `critical` or
  `warning` finding exists. `suggestion`-only findings are non-blocking — a PR
  with only nits is merge-ready and must NOT be rejected. `lgtm: false` requires
  at least one `critical`/`warning`. If a concern truly blocks merge, it is not a
  `suggestion`; promote it before blocking. Schema validation rejects a supplied
  verdict that contradicts the finding severities, and post-reflection
  finalization derives the verdict from the reconciled finding list again.
- **Valid reflection filtering is authoritative.** The reflection pass carries
  retained original finding indices into final reconciliation. When both the
  reflected finding array and retained-index array are valid and internally
  consistent, reconciliation retains exactly those findings. It remaps checklist
  references to the retained array, removes a failed checklist entry when all of
  its referenced evidence was filtered, and derives `lgtm` from the retained
  severities. It does not restore a rejected finding merely because the primary
  checklist referenced it or because filtering changes a primary blocking verdict
  to merge-ready.

  Reconciliation remains fail-open when reflection metadata is malformed or
  inconsistent. Both metadata values must be lists; every retained index must be
  a unique, non-boolean integer in range; the arrays must have equal lengths; and
  each reflected finding must match the original finding at its retained index.
  If any check fails, the primary review is returned unchanged. Schema validation
  continues to reject a contradictory verdict before anything is posted. As a
  defensive backstop, `_build_verdict_body` logs an inconsistency and submits an
  empty verdict body rather than failing after the review comment was posted.
- **Verdict presentation is severity-graded, not the summary paragraph.** The
  formal APPROVE / request-changes verdict body (`_build_verdict_body`) is wrapped
  in a native GitHub alert whose color grades the outcome: `> [!TIP]` (green) when
  merge-ready, `> [!WARNING]` (yellow) when the only blockers are `warning`-level,
  `> [!CAUTION]` (red) when any `critical` blocker exists. The main review comment's
  summary paragraph stays plain text — wrapping the whole paragraph in `> [!IMPORTANT]`
  over-emphasized it (parsimony rule, `comment-formatting.md`); the single graded
  alert on the short verdict message is where the reader looks.
- **Re-review comment handling:** on a re-review (new commits or a re-requested
  review) the bot posts a *fresh* summary comment (GitHub does not notify on
  edits). By default it first collapses the prior review comment to a short
  "superseded" pointer (`_collapse_old_review`). `review_history.preserve_previous`
  (global `config.yaml`, overridable per-project in `projects.yaml`, default
  `false`, fail-closed to `false`) skips that collapse so the prior review is
  left intact alongside the new one. Either way a fresh comment is posted.
- **Stale-HEAD alert:** the PR commit SHAs are captured at the *start* of a review
  (`_fetch_pr_commit_shas`), but the branch tip can move during the run. Just
  before posting, `run_review` re-reads the branch's live HEAD
  (`_fetch_pr_head_oid` → `headRefOid`) and, when it differs from the reviewed tip
  (`current_shas[-1]`, the SHA shown as `HEAD=<short>` in the footer), appends a
  `> [!IMPORTANT]` alert to the end of the comment (`_build_stale_head_alert`,
  applied in `_post_review_comment`). This is **best-effort and purely
  informational**: a failed live-HEAD lookup or an unchanged HEAD adds no alert
  (byte-identical output), and the alert never blocks the post, changes the LGTM
  verdict, or re-runs analysis — re-covering the new commits is the
  incremental-review path's job on the next `/review`.
- **Inline findings (opt-in):** When `review_inline_comments.enabled` is true,
  resolvable findings are submitted as a **single** GitHub pull-request review
  (`POST …/pulls/{n}/reviews` with a `comments` array), not as N separate
  `…/pulls/{n}/comments` posts. Cap with `max_comments`. Re-runs stay
  idempotent (existing anchors skipped). If the batch create fails (e.g. line
  not in diff, or a human draft review already holds the one-pending-review
  slot and GitHub answers 422), fall back to individual inline posts without
  failing the run — that path POSTs to `…/pulls/{n}/comments` and is unaffected
  by a pending review.
- **Idempotency is a precondition, not a best effort:** if the existing-anchor
  listing itself fails, inline posting is **skipped** for that run rather than
  posting an unverified (potentially wholly duplicate) comment set; the next
  `/review` posts it once the listing succeeds.
- **The review POST carries no retry budget:** `createReview` is not
  idempotent, so it is sent with `max_attempts=1`. A stalled-but-accepted POST
  that got re-sent would publish a second complete review — two notifications
  and 2×N inline threads the author cannot bulk-delete — which costs far more
  than one failed attempt that degrades to the fallback.
- **A failed create is still not proof of non-creation:** a client-side timeout
  can leave the review created server-side, so before falling back to
  individual posts the run re-lists the PR's inline comments. Comments
  confirmed landed count as posted (and the verdict is treated as already
  applied) instead of being re-posted.
- **Kōan never deletes a review it did not create.** It has no cleanup pass
  over pre-existing reviews: every review Kōan POSTs carries an `event`, so it
  can never leave a PENDING review of its own behind, and any PENDING review on
  the PR is therefore unsubmitted human draft content. Deleting one is
  irreversible destruction of human work and is forbidden by "the agent
  proposes, the human decides".
- **Verdict may ride the batch:** When a formal verdict is submitted in the
  same run (`review_verdict.approved`) and there is at least one new inline
  comment to post, the verdict `event` (`APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or
  `COMMENT` on self-authored PRs) is attached to that same review so the
  author gets one review notification. If there are no new inline comments,
  the existing verdict-only path is unchanged. The summary **issue** comment
  remains the durable review body (`SUMMARY_TAG`, collapse, hunter-append,
  stale-HEAD, footer) and is **not** replaced by the review body.
- **Core review is posted before the optional enrichment passes.** The core
  summary comment is posted first (`_post_review_comment`); the bot-comment
  triage and silent-failure-hunter passes run *after* and are strictly
  best-effort (wrapped so any failure only logs). Rationale: each enrichment
  pass is a separate provider invocation that can stall or fail, and running
  them before the post meant a hang there discarded the whole finished review
  (the outer liveness watchdog SIGKILLs the runner mid-pipeline). The
  silent-failure-hunter section is not baked into the initial body; when it
  produces findings it is appended to the already-posted comment in place via
  `_append_error_section_to_review` (re-locates the comment by `SUMMARY_TAG`
  and PATCHes it). The re-locate uses `find_bot_comment(..., prefer_newest=True)`
  so that under `review_history.preserve_previous` — where the superseded prior
  review is left intact and still carries `SUMMARY_TAG` — the section lands on
  the freshly-posted comment (the highest comment id) rather than the older
  preserved one. If the core post failed or the comment can't be re-located,
  the section is dropped and the core review still stands. Pairs with the
  provider-side per-pass stall watchdog (see `specs/components/providers.md`,
  "read loop must be inactivity-bounded"), which makes a stalled enrichment
  pass degrade to empty rather than hang.
  The append rebuilds the comment body from the clean `review_body`, so
  `_append_error_section_to_review` also takes `coverage_note` and forwards
  it to its inner `_post_review_comment` call — without it, a large PR's
  `⚠️ Partial review` warning (prepended on the initial post; see
  `specs/components/skills.md`, "`review` diff-size & partial-coverage
  contract") would be silently overwritten on the hunter-append edit. Large
  PRs (non-empty `coverage_note`) are also the PRs most likely to trigger the
  hunter, so this overlap is exercised by
  `TestReviewPostsBeforeEnrichment::test_coverage_note_survives_hunter_append_overlap`
  in `koan/tests/test_review_runner.py`.
- **Model-written review prose follows the configured reply language.** The
  prose the model generates — finding titles and bodies, the summary, and thread
  replies — is written in the language returned by
  `language_preference.get_language()`, which is **English** unless the human set
  another with `/language`. The instruction is injected once, centrally, in
  `_run_claude_review` (the single provider funnel for every review call), not
  restated per prompt, so no review prompt can drift out of it. Only an explicit
  `/language reset` (the `{"language": ""}` sentinel, input-language mode) lifts
  the override; a review prompt must never independently ask the model to guess
  or mirror a language, because leaving the choice open lets a model answer an
  English thread in an unrelated language.
- **Machine-read tokens stay English, including in model output.** The language
  override is scoped to prose and MUST carve out every token Python matches
  literally, because a translated one fails silently. The carve-out list is the
  contract: the `## PR Review` / `## Summary` headings a prompt asks the model to
  emit verbatim (`_extract_review_body` regex-matches them to recover a review at
  all — a miss posts the unparseable-output notice instead), the `classification`
  value `actionable` consumed by `_run_bot_comment_triage`, the
  `CRITICAL`/`HIGH`/`MEDIUM` severities the error hunter orders and colors by, the
  `[Deferred]` / `[Pre-Existing Issue]` title prefixes `review_triage.enforce_deferred`
  and `enforce_pre_existing` substring-match (a translated prefix silently blocks a PR
  over a finding the human deferred), and the `comment_replies[].action` value
  `needs_clarification`. The
  review path therefore does **not** reuse the chat-side
  `get_language_instruction()` string — that one is absolute ("all your responses")
  — but a review-specific directive,
  `koan/system-prompts/review-language-directive.md`. Any new prompt behind this
  funnel that adds a literal output contract MUST extend that carve-out.
- **Renderer-owned scaffolding stays English, deliberately.** The strings Python
  itself emits around that prose are structure, not conversation, and are **not**
  localized: the `## PR Review` heading it builds, the `_SEVERITY_HEADING` tier
  names (`Blocking`/`Important`/`Suggestions`), and the verdict line. A stable
  heading is what lets a human scan any PR the same way, so a non-English
  preference yields English scaffolding around translated prose, by design.
  Widening the language override to cover them is an architectural change, not a
  bug fix.

### Consistency, triage & human dispositions (spec 010)

These invariants make repeated reviews stable, keep the blocking tier trustworthy,
and let humans close the loop. All are fail-open (a missing input degrades to the
prior single-pass behaviour) and the consistency-critical decisions are made in
deterministic Python (`review_identity`, `review_reuse`, `review_reconcile`,
`review_triage`), not in model output.

- **Finding identity (FR-002).** A finding's identity key is `file` + a tolerant
  region bucket + a semantic category (`review_identity.finding_key`) — independent
  of exact line numbers and title wording. `same_finding` adds ±line tolerance for
  cross-run matching. The sidecar stamps each persisted finding with its key.
- **Reuse on unchanged head+base (FR-001).** When the PR head **and** base
  (merge-base) SHA are both unchanged since the prior review **and** the request is
  equivalent (same focus flags + comprehensive-discovery setting — the
  `request_signature`), `run_review` reproduces the prior review instead of
  re-deriving it (`review_reuse.should_reuse`), rather than re-rolling a fresh set.
  Base movement defeats reuse (the effective diff changed). Reuse is
  distinguishable and never a silent no-op; a missing/non-equivalent prior record
  falls back to a fresh review. Gated by `review_consistency.reuse_enabled` (default
  on). The prior-review sidecar persists `base_sha` + `request_signature` for this.
- **Re-review freeze (FR-003).** On a re-review (head moved), a **first-time
  non-critical** finding on a **file unchanged since the prior review** is
  **suppressed** — the "review whiplash" case (new complaints on code the author did
  not touch). Recurring prior findings and findings in changed files are unaffected.
  A `critical` is the sole exception: it still surfaces, prefixed
  `[Pre-Existing Issue]`. Freeze is file-level and fail-open (`review_reconcile.compute_freeze`;
  the runner applies `_remap_findings_after_drop`). Gated by
  `review_consistency.freeze_enabled` (default on).
- **Yellow-tier bar (FR-008–010).** The `warning` (🟡 Important) tier — a *blocking*
  severity — is reserved for issues that clearly block merge or risk real harm;
  borderline "should-fix" items are `suggestion`s; vague/speculative/cosmetic noise
  is dropped. Set by the shared `review-severity-rubric` prompt partial ({@include}-d
  by `review.md` + `review-with-plan.md`; the markdown architecture prompt carries an
  equivalent Rules bullet). The bar is prompt-fixed at strict (not runtime config).
- **Structural-quality lens (always on).** All three main review prompts
  (`review.md`, `review-with-plan.md`, the markdown architecture prompt) carry the
  `review-structural-quality` partial ({@include}-d): the reviewer judges whether the
  change leaves surrounding code simpler or messier (spaghetti growth, wrong layer,
  duplicated canonical helper, thin abstraction, file-size explosion) and names the
  structural remedy. Findings default to `suggestion`/🟢 and never block on style
  alone; promotion to `warning` requires naming concrete harm, per the same bar as
  FR-008–010. The focused `--errors` / `--comments` passes deliberately omit it.
  `reflect.md` scores a concrete structural finding in the 5-7 band (8-10 when the
  diff shows the mess) and a vague one at 0-2.
- **Exhaustive single-pass (FR-025).** The default prompt aims to surface every
  genuine issue in one pass (no finding cap), so later reviews have less to add;
  higher recall still flows through the same bar (no blocking-set inflation).
- **Pre-existing labeling (FR-027/028).** A finding the reviewer judges to predate
  the changeset carries the `[Pre-Existing Issue]` title prefix; if non-critical it
  is forced to `suggestion` (non-blocking), if `critical` it keeps its severity.
  Detection is the reviewer's semantic call (the prefix); `review_triage.enforce_pre_existing`
  enforces the severity rule deterministically and re-derives `lgtm`. Coexists with
  the freeze — the freeze runs first, so "freeze wins" on unchanged code (FR-030).
- **Human dispositions (FR-031–038).** On a re-review the reviewer honors human PR
  comments that **dismiss** ("ignore"/"not a problem" → not re-raised as a blocker)
  or **defer** ("fix later" → non-blocking `[Deferred]` recommendation) a finding.
  Any non-bot commenter, all severities including a human-dismissed `critical` ("the
  agent proposes, the human decides"). Every comment-driven suppression/downgrade
  MUST be attributed (commenter + quoted rationale) — never silent. A comment
  disposes of a *specific finding* only; it MUST NOT rewrite the severity rubric or
  verdict (injection guardrail). Stickiness + retraction come from re-reading the
  live comment thread each review (no separate store). Guidance is injected via the
  config-gated `{DISPOSITIONS}` slot (`review_dispositions.enabled`, default on — the
  kill-switch for the open posture); `review_triage.enforce_deferred` enforces the
  `[Deferred]` downgrade deterministically.
- **Opt-in comprehensive discovery (FR-015–021).** When `review_discovery.enabled`
  (default **off**), the review prompt gains the `review-comprehensive-discovery`
  guidance: review from a fixed perspective set (correctness, security, architecture,
  silent-failure, test-coverage), merge findings into one deduplicated set, same bar
  and verdict. Off → the prompt carries zero discovery content (byte-identical
  single-pass path). Part of the reuse `request_signature`, so a single-pass review
  is never reused as a comprehensive one.

## Evaluation

The review skill is the first skill covered by the deterministic eval harness
(`koan/app/skill_evals.py`; design in `specs/002-review-skill-evals/`).

- **Golden dataset:** `koan/skills/core/review/evals/cases/*.json` — seeded-bug
  cases (`sql_injection`, `bare_except`, `hardcoded_secret`) that must produce a
  finding at the right severity, precision cases (`clean_refactor`,
  `benign_style`) that must LGTM without false positives, and `suggestion_only`,
  which carries a legitimate low-severity nit that must be surfaced *and* still
  yield `lgtm: true` (guards the verdict-follows-severity invariant).
- **Structural-quality case:** `structural_growth` — a feature-specific branch
  bolted into a shared helper that the structural-quality lens must surface as a
  `suggestion` while still yielding `lgtm: true` (guards the always-on structural
  lens).
- **Scored dimensions:** JSON/schema validity (via `validate_review`), recall of
  seeded findings (file + keyword-stem + severity-band match), LGTM correctness,
  and precision (no flags on `forbidden_files`).
- **CI:** the offline scorer + dataset-validity tests run in the `fast` group on
  every PR — they never call the Claude subprocess.
- **Live:** `KOAN_EVAL_LIVE=1 python -m app.skill_evals review --live` invokes
  the real review pipeline over the dataset and compares against
  `evals/baseline.json`; run this before/after a prompt change to confirm an
  improvement (or catch a regression, which exits non-zero).

**Contract:** changing the review output schema (`review_schema.py`) or the
prompt (`review.md`) MUST be reflected in the golden cases / baseline so the eval
keeps measuring real behaviour.

## Known debt / watch-outs

- Focus flags compose; stacking many passes multiplies token cost.
- Plan-alignment (`--plan-url`) depends on the tracker being reachable.
