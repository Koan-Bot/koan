"""Verified, resumable publishing of the current Jira plan comment.

A plan is an expensive model run, so it is staged on disk before Koan tries to
deliver it. Delivery is then verified by reading the comment back: Jira's write
endpoints report success on responses that never became a visible comment, so
an unverified write is treated as a failure and the staged plan is kept for the
next mission run rather than regenerated.

Plans too large for a single Jira comment are published as consecutive parts.
Jira's public REST API has no reply-to-comment operation, so the parts are
linked to each other with focused-comment URLs instead of being threaded.
